class LUTSurface(Surface):
    """A model of the surface based on an N-dimensional lookup table
    indexed by one or more state vector elements.  We calculate the
    reflectance by multilinear interpolation.  This is good for
    surfaces like aquatic ecosystems or snow that can be
    described with just a few degrees of freedom.

    The lookup table must be precalculated based on the wavelengths
    of the instrument.  It is stored with other metadata in a matlab-
    format file. For an n-dimensional lookup table, it contains the
    following fields:
      - grids: an object array containing n lists of gridpoints
      - data: an n+1 dimensional array containing the reflectances
         for each gridpoint
      - bounds: a list of n [min,max] tuples representing the bounds
         for all state vector elements
      - statevec_names: an array of n strings representing state
         vector element names
      - mean: an array of n prior mean values, one for each state
         vector element
      - sigma: an array of n prior standard deviations, one for each
         state vector element
      - scale: an array of n scale values, one for each state vector
         element
