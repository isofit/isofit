# Test a package built and installed by pip.
#
# Test ISOFIT on a variety of versions of Python. This test suite is likely
# sufficient for broadly testing the 'pip' package, with the assumption that
# users are able to get all dependencies installed. Any further testing should
# be for a specific environment, and be very targeted.
#
# For example, testing Ubuntu 22.04 package ecosystem should likely be done by
# building a deb for ISOFIT, and testing against the Python packages provided by
# the apt package repo. It may also be possible to test this environment with a
# mix of upstream packages and a non-isolated virtual environment built with the
# '--system-site-packages' flag.
#
# Readers looking at this file for the purposes of installing ISOFIT on their
# system should be aware that these tests run in an isolated manner. Be aware
# that both 'pip' and 'apt/apt-get' can both be used to install Python
# packages, but pip installing something with Ubuntu's system Python will
# conflict with packages installed via 'apt/apt-get', and produce an environment
# that is difficult to unwind.
